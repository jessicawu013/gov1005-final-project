There is a slight concern with my project, which is that at some point so many
people may have the disease that there will no longer be accurate records of the
data.

The data is changing incredibly rapidly, more so than I anticipated even last week.
For these reasons, I've decided to limit the scope of my project to just the U.S.,
as there will soon be more than enough cases to have a significant dataset just within
the U.S. This week, I figured out how I might be able to efficiently continuously
update my project with the changing data. Also, rather than uploading each day's
new data, it makes far more sense to use the timeseries data on the JHU github.

## Uploading all of my datasets here.

Here are the datasets from JHU, which tracks of all the confirmed cases,
including current cases, deaths, and recoveries.

These datasets are timeseries, which log the number of confirmed/recovered/deaths,
with each successive date as its own column. 
```{r jhu_time_series_confirmed, echo=FALSE}

# These are the confirmed U.S. cases up to 03/20/2020.

confirmed <- read_csv("COVID-19/2020-03-20/time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv") %>%
  filter(`Country/Region` == 'US') %>%
  select(-`Country/Region`, 
         -Lat,
         -Long,
         -starts_with("1"),
         -starts_with("2")) %>%
  rename(state = `Province/State`) %>%
  filter(!state == 'Diamond Princess') %>%
  filter(!state == "Grand Princess") %>%
  head(55) %>%
  pivot_longer(-state, names_to = "date", values_to = "count")

# changing date from type character to type date
confirmed$date <- as.Date(confirmed$date, "%m/%d/%y")

```


```{r)}

gt(confirmed) %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Time Series of Confirmed Cases")
```

```{r jhu_time_series_deaths, echo=FALSE}

# These are the DEATH cases up to 03/20/2020.

deaths <- read_csv("COVID-19/2020-03-20/time_series_19-covid-Deaths.csv") %>%
  filter(`Country/Region` == 'US') %>%
  select(!`Country/Region`) %>%
  select(!Lat) %>%
  select(!Long) %>%
  rename(state = `Province/State`) %>%
  filter(!state == 'Diamond Princess') %>%
  filter(!state == "Grand Princess") %>%
  head(55)

gt(deaths) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Time Series of Deaths")
```

```{r jhu_time_series_recovered, echo=FALSE}

# These are the RECOVERED cases up to 03/07/2020.

recovered <- read_csv("COVID-19/2020-03-20/time_series_19-covid-Recovered.csv") %>%
  filter(`Country/Region` == 'US') %>%
  select(-`Country/Region`, 
         -Lat,
         -Long,
         -starts_with("1"),
         -starts_with("2")) %>%
  rename(state = `Province/State`) %>%
  filter(!state == 'Diamond Princess') %>%
  filter(!state == "Grand Princess") %>%
  head(55)

gt(recovered) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Time Series of Recoveries")

```



These datasets are daily reports, which I no longer think I will be using.

```{r jhu_daily_reports}
a01222020 <- read_csv("COVID-19/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/01-22-2020.csv")

a02282020 <- read_csv("COVID-19/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/02-28-2020.csv")
```


Here is the stock market data.

```{r stock_market}

# This is the historical data for the S&P 500 from Yahoo Finance, which contains
# the daily data since the start of March 2019, but we will only be looking at
# data since November 2019.

SP500 <- read_csv("^GSPC.csv")

## https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/
```

Here is the data of racial incidences targeting Asian Americans.
```{r}

# This data is currently nonexistent because I will have to hand-compile it
# by sifting through news articles and tracking location, date, incident type.

```

Here is the data scraped from Facebook and Twitter.

```{r}

# Clearly I have not figured out how to scrape social media, but I will get there.
# Now that the scope has been limited to the U.S., I will be tracking combinations
# of words, such as "conspiracy" and "coronavirus", or "coronavirus" and "chink."

```
